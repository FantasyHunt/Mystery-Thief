//Chapter One: The Quiet Nights of Panama

//In the heart of 18th-century Panama, where the lush jungle met the cobblestone streets of a quiet coastal town, young Nuriah lived a life filled with wonder and simplicity. Nestled in a small cottage with her loving parents and her mischievous little brother, Zayzay, they found joy in the everyday moments, sharing stories by the firelight and savoring the flavors of tropical fruits.

//Nuriah's father, Alejandro, worked as a nurse for Dr. Salvador Mendoza, a respected physician in town known for his enigmatic demeanor and vast knowledge of medicine. Dr. Mendoza's reputation, however, concealed a dark secret that Alejandro would soon stumble upon.

//One evening, as Nuriah and Zayzay played in the courtyard, their father returned home with a troubled expression. He had noticed strange occurrences at the clinicâ€”patients whose once-vibrant memories seemed to have vanished, leaving them in a state of confusion and despair. The memories, he soon learned, were being stolen by Dr. Mendoza for a sinister purpose.

//Intrigued by this discovery, Alejandro decided to dig deeper, making discreet inquiries to fellow nurses and confiding in Nuriah about his concerns. Little did he know that his inquiries did not go unnoticed. Dr. Mendoza, a man who took pride in his power to control the minds of those he cared for, had become aware of Alejandro's suspicions.

//As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the town, Nuriah and Zayzay listened intently to their father's story. Worried for their parents' safety and their own, Nuriah vowed to find a way to save her family and put an end to Dr. Mendoza's wicked scheme.
